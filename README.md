# Compiler Exercises

This project is done to track and test what I understood from the book "Engineering a Compiler".
What you'll find in here is a fast-written non-compatible list of little projects that put into practice what I've learned from the book.
I've chosen python as the language because it's really easy to write down things and everything can be visualized without much code, performance is not the main focus of this project as my understanding of the lessons takes precedence.

Wheter you are a stranger or a future version of me, good luck reading trough this non-documented mess of exercises.
